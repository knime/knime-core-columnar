        This table backend is currently part of KNIME Labs. It is not yet advised to<br />
        use this backend productively.
    </p>

    <p style="padding-top:10px">
        The columnar table backend was introduced with KNIME Analytics Platform<br />
        version 4.2.3. It caches data off-heap and can give noticeable speed-ups over<br />
        the <i>Default</i> format. Future versions of KNIME will bring improvements to this<br />
        format for increased stability and even greater (order of magnitude) speed-ups.
    </p>

    <p style="padding-top:10px">
        Please also review the settings in the KNIME preferences<br />
        (File &rarr; Preferences &rarr; KNIME &rarr; Table Backend &rarr; Columnar Storage (Labs)).
