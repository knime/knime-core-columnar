		This table format was introduced with version KNIME Analytics Platform<br />
		4.2.2 and is part of KNIME Labs. It uses a more compact data<br />
		representation and is, compared to the <i>Default</i> format, more<br />
		memory friendly. Using this format can give some noticeable speed-up.<br />
		Future versions of KNIME will contain improvements to this format so<br />
		that individual nodes will show a significant (order of magnitude)
		gain<br /> in execution time.

		Please also review the global cache settings in the KNIME<br />
		preferences (File -> Preferences -> KNIME -> Data Storage).
